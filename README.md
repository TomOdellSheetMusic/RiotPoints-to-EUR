# RiotPoints to EUR converter
A simple .net program to convert the value of RP in its various bundles into euros. You can input any value of RiotPoints and get a table for every bundle,
how much you would have to pay upfront and what the best value is! (although thats always just the most expensive pack)

## Requirements
None for the RPtoEUR.standalone.exe. Just download and run it from the Release tab. 

## Build it yourself
[.net framework](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/thank-you/runtime-desktop-6.0.15-windows-x64-installer) (tested with .net 5,6,7)

## Usage
Either build it yourself using your favourite IDE or just run the exe after installing the .net framwork
